## Thoughts/Build Process
I knew I wanted exposure making an e-commerce site. I came up with the idea of a 'paid interaction' allowing the users to pay $1 for each message sent and requiring a response of 100 characters or more to satisfy that 1 dollar spent. Part of the proceeds going to the responder thus incentivizing that interaction.

With that in mind I sat out to use the Stripe API for secure payments ensuring I would never have any credit card information being stored on the database. The Stripe API was relatively straight forward and intuitive.

I went with a relatively clean color palette for the design approach going for a 'dark theme'. 

## Future Plans
I want to flesh out the idea of the community of responders. Allowing more people to sign up to be a responder and then setting up an automated payment system to 'pay out' part of their interaction. 

### Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed working on this project. Working on a Full-stack project really gives you the full experience of designing an app.
